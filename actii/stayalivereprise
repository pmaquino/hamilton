(Stay alive)
(Stay alive) where's my son?
Mr. Hamilton, come in, they brought him in a half an hour ago
He lost a lot of blood on the way over (Stay alive) is he alive?
Yes, but you have to understand
The bullet entered just above his hip and lodged in his right arm
Can I see him please?

I'm doing everything I can but the wound was already infected when he arrived

Philip
Pa!
I did exactly as you said, Pa
I held my head up high

I know, I know, shh
I know, I know, shh
I know you did everything just right, shh

Even before we got to ten (shh)
I was aiming for the sky (I know, I know, shh)
I was aiming for the sky

I know, save your strength and stay alive!

Eliza!
Is he breathing, is he going to survive this? (Stay alive)

Who did this, Alexander, did you know?
Mom, I'm so sorry for forgetting what you taught me
My son
We played piano (I taught you piano)
You would put your hands on mine

You changed the melody every time (ha)
I would always change the line
Shh, I know, I know
I would always change the line
I know, I know
