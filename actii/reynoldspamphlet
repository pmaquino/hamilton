The Reynolds Pamphlet
Have you read this?
Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair
And he wrote it down right there
Highlights!
"The charge against me is in connection
With one James Reynolds
For purposes of improper speculation
My real crime is an amorous connection with his wife
For a considerable time with his knowing consent"
Damn!
"I had frequent meetings with her
Most of them at my own house"
At his own house!
At his own house
Damn!
"Mrs. Hamilton, with our children, being absent
On a visit to her father"
No
Boo!
Have you read this?
Well, he's never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now
That's one less thing to worry about
That's one less thing to worry about
I came as soon as I heard (What?)
Angelica-
All the way from London?!
Damn!
Angelica, thank God
Someone who understands what I'm
Struggling here to do
I'm not here for you (Ooh!)
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
I love my sister more than anything in this life
I will choose her happiness over mine every time
Put what we had aside, I'm standing at her side
You could never be satisfied, God, I hope you're satisfied
Well, he's never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now
That's one less thing to worry about
That's one less thing to worry about
Hey, at least he(I) was honest with our (He's never gon' be President now)
Money (He's never gon' be President now)
Never gon' be president now
Hey, at least he(I) was honest with our (He's never gon' be President now)
Money (That's one less thing to worry about)
That's one less thing to worry about
