They say
George Washington's yielding his power and stepping away
Is that true?
I wasn't aware that was something a person could do
I'm perplexed
Are they going to keep on replacing whoever's in charge?
If so, who's next?
There's nobody else in their country who looms quite as large
John Adams?
I know him
That can't be
That's that little guy who spoke to me
All those years ago
What was it, eighty-five?
That poor man, they're gonna eat him alive!
Oceans rise
Empires fall
Next to Washington, they all look small
All alone
Watch them run
They will tear each other into pieces
Jesus Christ, this will be fun!
Da da da dat da dat da da da dai ya da
Da da da dat dat dai ya da, hahahahaha!
President John Adams
Good luck!
