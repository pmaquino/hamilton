How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common
We're reliable with the
Ladies
There are so many to deflower
Ladies
Looks
Proximity to power
Ladies
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him
That's true
Seventeen-eighty
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?
Hey
Hey
Hey hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
