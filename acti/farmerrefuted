Hear ye, hear ye my name is Samuel Seabury
And I present free thoughts on the proceedings of the continental congress
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart
Oh my God tear this dude apart
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This congress does not speak for me
Let him be
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame
Yo he'd have you all unravel at the sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin' the have-nots are gonna
Win this it's hard to listen to you with a straight face
Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk
And what about Boston?
Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk about congress?
This Congress does not speak for me
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee
You're playing a dangerous game but strangely, your mange is the same
I pray the king shows you his mercy
Is he in Jersey?
For shame, for the Revolution
For shame, for the Revolution
Heed, if you repeat yourself again I'm gonna
Scream, honestly, look at me, please don't read
Not your interest
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?
Alexander, please
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties
Silence amessage from the king
A message from the king, a message from the king
