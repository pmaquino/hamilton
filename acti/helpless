Ohh, I do I do I do I Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I Dooo!
Boy, you got me helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in 'em
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went
"Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
Grab my sister, and whisper
"Yo, this one's mine." (Oooh)
My sister made her way across the room to you (Oooh)
And I got nervous, thinking
"What's she gonna do?" (Oooh)
She grabs you by the arm, I'm thinkin'
"I'm through" (Oooh)
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!
Look into your eyes (Oh, look at those eyes)
And the sky's the limit (Oh!)
I'm helpless (I know)
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em
I'm helpless! (I'm so into you)
Look into your eyes (I am so)
And the sky's the limit (into you)
I'm helpless! (I know)
I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em
Where are you taking me?
I'm about to change your life
Then by all means, lead the way
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you
Schuyler?
My sister
Thank you for all your service
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet
It will have been worth it
I'll leave you to it
One week later
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better
Every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, 'cause she wants to form a harem
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me
You would share him
Ha! Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stonefaced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as you wine and dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
'Cause there's nothing that your mind can't do (Oooh)
My father makes his way across the room to you (Oooh)
I panic for a second, thinking
"We're through" (Oooh)
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true" (Oooh)
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit, I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count (Woo)
And I'm drownin' in 'em
I'm helpless!
He's mine, that boy is mine!
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit, I'm
Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in 'em
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command
A dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God, you'll never feel so
I do I do I do I do!
Eliza (Helpless!)
I do I do I do I do!
I've never felt so-
Helpless! (Hey! Yeah, yeah!)
Down for the count and
I'm drownin' in 'em (Down for the count I'm)
My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it
I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm (Helpless!)
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em
In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man
Helpless!
