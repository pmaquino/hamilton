Alright, alright
That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone
Give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
A toast to the groom!
(To the groom!)
(To the groom!)
(To the groom!)
To the bride!
(To the bride!)
(To the bride!)
(To the bride!)
From your sister
(Angelica!)
(Angelica!)
(Angelica!)
Who is always by your side
(By your side)
(By your side)
To your union!
(To the union!)
(To the revolution!)
And the hope that you provide!
(Provide, to provide)
And may you always
(Always)
Be satisfied
Rewind
Rewind
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night
I remember that
I remember that night
I just might regret that night
For the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves
To win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place
But Alexander, I'll never forget
The first time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi"
I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame
Every part aflame
This is not a game
"You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied"
"I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself"
"You're like me. I'm never satisfied"
"Is that right?"
"I have never been satisfied"
"My name is Angelica Schuyler"
"Alexander Hamilton"
"Where's your family from?"
"Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but"
"Just you wait, just you wait"
So, so, so
So this is what it feels like
To match wits with someone at your level
What the hell is the catch?
It's the feeling of freedom
Of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite!
You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes
Maybe three minutes
Everything we said in total agreement
It's a dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance
He's a bit of a flirt, but I'm 'a give it a chance
I asked about his family
Did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting
He looked askance?
He's penniless
He's flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face
And she is
"Helpless"
And I know she is
"Helpless"
And her eyes are just
"Helpless"
And I realize three fundamental truths
At the exact same time
"Where are you taking me?"
"I'm about to change your life"
"Then by all means, lead the way"
I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so
I'm the one who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest
And the gossip in New York City, is insidious
And Alexander is penniless, ha
That doesn't mean I want him any less
"Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you"
"Schuyler?"
"My sister"
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status
I'd have to be naive to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied
"Thank you for all your service"
"If it takes fighting a war for us to meet
It will have been worth it"
"I'll leave you to it"
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say "I'm fine"
She'd be lying
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might have been
If I hadn't sized him up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life
To the Groom!
(To the groom!)
(To the groom!)
(To the groom!)
To the Bride!
(To the bride!)
(To the bride!)
(To the bride!)
From your sister
(Angelica!)
(Angelica!)
(Angelica!)
Who is always by your side
(By your side!)
(By your side!)
To your union!
(To the union!)
(To the revolution!)
And the hope that you provide!
(Provide, to provide)
May you always
(Always)
Be satisfied
(Be satisfied)
(Be satisfied)
(Be satisfied)
And I know
She'll be happy as his bride
And I know
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied
